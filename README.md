# Worldwide-Coffee-Habits-Dataset-using-Tableau
This is a dataset of Worldwide Coffee Habits, a comprehensive resource designed to illuminate global coffee consumption trends. It offers a detailed look into coffee consumption patterns across various countries, providing valuable insights into how coffee is enjoyed worldwide.
The dataset contains Country, Years, Coffee Consumption yearly, Average coffee price per kg of coffee, Coffee type, and the population in millions.
The preparation of data
I used  Excel to eliminate any duplicates and clean the data. Any blank spaces were removed.
I imported the data to Tableau to do some visualization.
Objectives
1.	Which coffee has been consumed a lot?
2.	What effect does the population have on the consumption level of coffee?
3.	What effect does price have on coffee consumption?
Findings
If you plan to start a coffee shop, Coffee Latte was the most consumed coffee with  12,533 and Americano the least with 11,890. 
The population has a positive correlation with coffee consumption. The higher the population, the higher the coffee consumption.
The average price of coffee also has a negative correlation with coffee consumption. The higher the price, the lower the consumption of coffee.
From the above findings, If you want to start a coffee shop, make sure the position you are setting up is in a place where the population is higher, as it will attract more customers. You are also aware of which kind of raw materials to stock first and which one not to prioritize. Lastly, make your price fair, as the price negatively affects coffee sales.
